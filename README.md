# Stock Market Decision API

This is a toy project of mine. I have implemented an API to provide some financial advice based on input stock market input data.
The API receives stock data and answers with an recommendation as "sell", "buy", "ignore" or "wait".

The project has been implemented using js, swagger, nodejs with express. 

It is running live with Pivotal CloudFoundry.
